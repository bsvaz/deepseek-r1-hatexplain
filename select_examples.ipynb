      "    is the person complaining about porn appearing on their timeline and then asking\n",
      "    \"which one of you niggers\". The intent here seems to be using the slur to refer\n",

      "    so maybe it's Hate Speech. But the intent might be more about criticizing\n",
      "    individuals rather than the entire group. Wait, \"negro bedwench\" is a term that\n",
      "    specifically targets Black women, so using that slur could be Hate Speech. The\n",
      "    difference between Offensive and Hate Speech is that Hate Speech attacks a group\n",
